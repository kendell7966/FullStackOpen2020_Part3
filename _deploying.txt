Deploying locally uses values in: .env

Deploying to production:

You must use the following Heroku command to set the connection string:
heroku config:set MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://fullstack:CtER5pyeZGUoJe52@cluster0-xtzm7.mongodb.net/phonebook-app?retryWrites=true

It seemed to work if the value is NOT surrounded by apostrophies.

The PORT will be automatically setup in the production environment.
